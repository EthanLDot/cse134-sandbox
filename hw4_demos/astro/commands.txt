npm create astro@latest
cd {NAME_OF_ASTRO_PROJECT}
npm run dev

The pages directory contains the .astro pages that will be accessible when you spin up your server
Your URLs during development will look something like:
http://localhost:4321/about

One quirk with Astro is that markdown files, as shown in pages/posts, can automatically be rendered in readable HTML.

Overall, https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/ does an excellent and straightforward intro to using Astro, 
though the quality of your Astro blog should be somewhat above what is presented here.
