        <p>
          Residents have expressed mixed reactions. While many are excited about
          the <ins>upgrades</ins> <del>changes</del>, some are concerned about
          the <ins>temporary closure of certain areas</ins>
          <del>potential noise and disruptions</del>.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I think this is a great step forward," said a local resident. "The
          park has needed an update for years."

        <p>
          However, others worry that <ins>some historic features</ins>
          <del>the charm</del> of the park may be lost in the process.
