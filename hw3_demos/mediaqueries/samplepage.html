            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              The Australian Silky Terrier is a small dog breed known for its
              long, fine, and silky coat. They are active, alert, and often
              described as having a big personality in a small body. Typically,
              they weigh between 8 to 10 pounds and stand around 10 to 11 inches
              tall at the shoulder.

            <h2>Care and Maintenance</h2>
            <p>
              Silky Terriers require regular grooming to keep their coats
              looking their best. Brushing should be done every other day to
              avoid tangles and mats. Their ears and eyes should be cleaned
              regularly, and their teeth should be brushed often.
            </p>

          <section id="history">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
              The Australian Silky Terrier originated in Australia in the late
              19th century. The breed was developed by crossing the Australian
              Terrier with the Yorkshire Terrier, aiming to produce a small yet
              strong and agile terrier. They were initially bred for hunting
              small game.

            <h2>Health</h2>
            <p>
              Silky Terriers are generally healthy dogs, but they can be prone
              to certain health conditions, including patellar luxation, dental
              issues, and heart problems. Regular check-ups and a balanced diet
              can help maintain their well-being.

          <section id="training">
            <h2>Training</h2>
            <p>
              Silky Terriers are intelligent and quick learners, but they can
              also be independent and stubborn. Early socialization and positive
              reinforcement training are key to a well-behaved dog. They respond
              well to short, consistent training sessions.
